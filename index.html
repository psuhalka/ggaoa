        <h4 style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">NOTICE</h4>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Important Update for Society Residents</h4>
        <p>Dear Residents -</p>
        <p>We want to inform you about some major works currently underway in our society to enhance our living environment.</p>
        <p>However, we urge everyone to be cautious, especially with our little ones, and ensure their safety during these renovations.</p>
        <p>Here are the ongoing projects:</p>
        <p>1. *Waterproofing of Garden Area*: We are currently in the process of waterproofing the garden area due to water seepage issues that have caused severe damage to pillars and beams in the basement. To prevent further damage, waterproofing measures are being implemented, and the affected pillars and beams in the basement are also being fixed. Residentâ€™s safety is our priority, and we're taking proactive steps to address this issue.</p>
        <p>2. *Whitewashing Corridors and Staircases*: To give our common areas a fresh and vibrant look, we are whitewashing the corridors and staircases. This will enhance the aesthetics of our surroundings and create a more pleasant environment for all.</p>
        <p>3. *Re-structuring of Front and Back Side Shades*: We are re-structuring the shades on the front and back sides of the buildings. This will not only improve the appearance of our society but also provide better protection from the elements.</p>
        <p>4. *Tiling Work on Building's Outer Wall*: Tiling work is being done on the outer walls of the buildings up to a height of 5 feet for added protection. This will help safeguard our buildings against wear and tear while enhancing their overall appearance.</p>
        <p>While these works are ongoing, we request everyone to keep a close eye on their children. Please ensure they stay away from the tools, equipment, raw materials, working areas, and gravels to avoid any accidents.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we advise against running in the driveway to prevent any mishaps.</p>
        <p>Your cooperation in ensuring the safety of everyone in our community is highly appreciated. Let's work together to make our society a safe and beautiful place to live.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your attention and cooperation!</p>
